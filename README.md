I enrolled in TripleTen's immersive Business Intelligence Analytics program in December of 2023. During my enrollment in this program I have had the opportunity to work on many projecs where I have been able to interpret data and create data visualizations that allow me and other team members to make strategic business decisions. I have become proficient in programs such as: Tableau, SQL and Power BI among others. 

Interesting facts about me:
- ✈️ I have lived in four cities and 3 states.
- 🌵 I actively seek out new experiences.
- 🏋🏻‍♀️ I am elite level drug tested powerlifter.
- 💪🏻 I can deadlift almost 400lbs.
- 🐕 My goal for 2024 is to get a job as a data/business analyst and to get a dog.
